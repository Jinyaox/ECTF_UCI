You are hired by a small firm called Raytheon. As a security designing team, you are asked to develop
A jet-entry key using TIVA C TM4C123GH6PM and the Jet's verification system

On jet's computer:
	A csv file is used as a database for all valid pilot keys
		
		CSV is one row with a list of valid passwords (you design this)
	
	A python interpreter is running for CSV look up

On key:
	
	Once the pilot click the button SW1, the key sends its key to the jet's computer

	If jet's computer verifies the key and pilot, an LED light should light up

	The Jet's computer will send an encrypted message as its private key


SECURITY REQUIREMENT:

	The secret key should not be revealed to any other party (store the hash)
	
	JUST BE SECURE, I cannot write too much (bro I have classes)
